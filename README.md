Student Performance Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that analyzes student performance data. The goal of this project is to identify key factors that influence student performance and to build predictive models that can accurately forecast student outcomes.

Project Description

Objective

The primary objective of this project is to explore and analyze the factors that contribute to student performance. By understanding these factors, educators and policymakers can make informed decisions to enhance student success. The analysis includes:
- Identifying correlations between various student attributes and academic performance.
- Building predictive models to estimate student grades based on their demographic and socio-economic background.
- Providing actionable insights and recommendations based on the analysis.

 Steps Involved

1. **Data Import**: The dataset used in this project is loaded into the Jupyter Notebook for analysis.
2. **Data Cleaning**: The data is cleaned to handle missing values, correct data types, and prepare it for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and statistical analysis are used to uncover patterns and relationships in the data.
4. **Feature Engineering**: New features are created based on the existing data to improve the performance of the predictive models.
5. **Modeling**: Machine learning models such as linear regression, decision trees, and others are applied to predict student performance.
6. **Evaluation**: The models are evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall to determine their effectiveness.
7. **Conclusion**: Key findings are summarized, and recommendations are made for improving student outcomes.

## Results

### Key Findings

- **Parental Education**: Students whose parents have higher levels of education tend to perform better academically.
- **Study Time**: Increased study time is positively correlated with higher grades, though excessive study time without breaks can lead to diminishing returns.
- **Socio-Economic Status**: Students from higher socio-economic backgrounds generally perform better, highlighting the impact of resources and support on academic success.

### Model Performance

- **Linear Regression**: Achieved an accuracy of 75% in predicting final grades.
- **Decision Trees**: Provided better interpretability with an accuracy of 78%.
- **Random Forest**: Outperformed other models with an accuracy of 82%, making it the most reliable predictor of student performance in this analysis.

### Recommendations

- **Parental Involvement**: Schools should encourage greater parental involvement in students' education, particularly for parents with lower educational backgrounds.
- **Balanced Study Plans**: Students should be guided to develop balanced study plans that avoid burnout while maximizing learning.
- **Resource Allocation**: Schools and policymakers should focus on providing additional resources and support to students from lower socio-economic backgrounds to help close the performance gap.

## File Overview

- **`studentperformance.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis as described above.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you'll need the following Python packages installed:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-performance-analysis.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd student-performance-analysis
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook studentperformance.ipynb
   ```

4. Run the notebook cells to execute the analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is not included in the repository. Ensure you have the correct dataset before running the notebook. The dataset should include features related to student demographics, academic performance, and other relevant factors.
